Data formats and algorithms for atmospheric soundings. The base crate is meant to be a common base 
for other crates to build on. These crates may be for managing a data-store, displaying data, or 
saving and loading files.

The emphasis of this crate is data representation and a common type for systems using sounding
data to build on and use.
