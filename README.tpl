This crate is deprecated as a whole and the functionality has been moved into the [sounding-analysis](https://github.com/rnleach/sounding-analysis) crate. The reasoning for the move was that the two crates are almost never used separately, and a change in this crate that required a version bump would then require a bump in the version of all the crates that depend on it. It became quite a chore to maintain related crates.
